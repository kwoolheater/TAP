TAP Application

This is an application that allows users to see prices of different alcohols, add alcohols to a list of favorites that is stored on their phone in Core Data, and view a cocktail recipe that they could make at their home. In the future this app will allow a user to order alcohol for cocktails to their home, but currently that functionality is not enabled.

Installation 

Clone the file from this github and then install the pod files.
